### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Doris Kung, and I am currently a second-year M.A. Economics student at NYU. I am expected to receive my master's degree from NYU in December 2023. Before pursuing my master degree, I was an equity research intern at [Kinvest Capital](https://www.kinvest.com.tw/), working on industry analysis, stock pitches, stock prediction and valuation Excel models for the global steel industry. Before joining Kinvest Capital, I was a research assistant for [Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute (MIC)](https://mic.iii.org.tw/english/) at [Institute for Information Industry (III)](https://web.iii.org.tw/), working on government-commissioned policy papers regarding digital transformation, MaaS, 5G, and electric vehicles.
